Zomgman 3 - Gun Game is a 2D split screen 2-player shooting game inspired by the Zomgman series made by Tristan Nishimoto. The screen is split into a top and bottom portion for players 1 and 2 respectively. Each player begins with a relatively weak pistol to kill each other with. When a player gets a kill, his/her gun is upgraded to a more powerful weapon. When a player gets killed, his/her gun is downgraded. The list of weapons is as follows: Glock, Uzi, MP5, AK47, Revolver, Shotgun, Sniper. Each weapon behaves differently and has its own advantages and disadvantages (ex: speed, fire mode, damage, reload time, etc.) Once a player gets the last weapon (sniper rifle), he/she has to get 3 consecutive kills with it (without dying) to win the game.

Rules:
Player 1 and 2 start off in their respective sides of the map both with the first weapon: the Glock. It is a semi-auto pistol that does relatively low damage.

When a player gets a kill, their gun is upgraded to the next one. The player that gets killed has his gun downgraded. The list of the guns is stated on the first page.

Player 1 input controls: W, A, S for movement (jump, go left, go right) â€“ respectively. SPACE to fire the weapon (Semi-auto will fire once, burst will fire 3 consecutive shots, auto will continue firing as you hold down SPACE).
Player 2 input controls: Arrow keys for movement, SHIFT to shoot. The same shooting mechanics apply for both players.
General controls: ESC to pause the game, mouse clicks for selections on the main screen.
